Netflix Ribbon Overview
Purpose: Netflix Ribbon provided client-side load balancing, fault tolerance, and resiliency for HTTP and TCP-based services.

Key Features:

Load Balancing: Distributed load balancing across multiple service instances.
Client-Side Load Balancer: Integrated with Eureka (Service Discovery) for dynamic server list updates.
Fault Tolerance: Automatic retry and failover handling for HTTP requests.
Customization: Configuration options for retry policies, load balancing algorithms, etc.
Integration with Spring Cloud:

Ribbon was commonly used with Spring Cloudâ€™s @LoadBalanced annotation to enable load balancing for RestTemplate and WebClient instances.
It worked seamlessly with Netflix Eureka for service discovery and dynamic server list updates.

Kubernetes : it has load balancer : we have to remove our ribbon based impl from our app code.
